### Summary of the Community's Needs
- My community here at Texas Tech University has grown so much in the past
  year.  I would like to continue growing it within the ACM and Hackathon
communities.  We need to get the number of participants from ~25-50 to over 50
students.  I would like to start reaching out more to other majors including
the ECE department and MIS majors.  We have connection to both and would like
to solidify and increase those connections.  We have just completed our team
for HackWesTX and have already started to communicate great!  We are working
together well and meeting every week to show our progress and issues with
planning our next Hackathon.  I would like to begin to increase the number of
workshops and infosessions that the ACM provides.

### Your Proposal
- Timing:
  - I am very focused on learning the different technologies that I can do
  workshops over.  This week we are doing a git and Github workshop that is due
to the git module.  I would like to finish the next 3 modules in the next
couple of weeks and get started planning the workshops for the ACM community.
- Community demographics:
  - I plan to reach out this week to the other students in realated fields in order
to increase the amount of exposure that the ACM gets and the amount of people
that we can help!
- Goals:
  - I hope to use my proposal to not only get to my goals but surpass them.
    In my assessment a big thing was getting more people involved.  I think
that this proposal sets a standard for how I want to aproach that and achieve
that goal.
- Communications:
  - Our community already has a base communication standard through Slack, but
    I would like to maybee implement some kind of forum or IRC channel to
better reach out to all students at Texas Tech.

### Your Proposal's Impact
- Target audience
  - I want to impact 1. CS students 2. ECE students 3. MIS students 4. Everyone
    else
- Community needs
  - A greater and more benificial learning experience with hands on and real
    world applications.
- Resources
  - The resources I need to accomplish my proposal include money and rooms.
    Through the ACM I am able to use our funds to bring in new technologies and
food/drinks for everyone.  I am also able to rent rooms for free on campus to
use for meetings and workshops.
- Media
  - I have access to a mailing list of the CS and ECE department.  Along with
    the vast majority of CS students in the slack channel.  To prepare for the
workshops I will do the different Modules of the open-training and maybee get
some help from others doing the same thing at there communities.
- Content knowledge
  - I am semi-knowledgeable about some of the technologies I want to do for
    workshops, but I am willing to learn and am very excited to help others
learn as well.  I also am apart of ACM and we have a vast amount of resources
available for me to use.  
- Timeline
  - I would like to finish all of my proposal by the end of this semester. (~
    December) I want to complete at lease 3 workshops spanning over the next
couple of months. The first workshop I am doing is on git and Github, and it is
on Oct. 6th.  The next workshop I would like to do is on Atom and do that the
last week of October.

### Planning for the Future
- I plan on reviewing my proposal on a bi-weekly basis.  I plan to add more
  goals and revise some others if needed.  I am also beginning planning for the
next hackathon in February
- I will measure success by being held responsable by the other members of the
  ACM.  They are counting on me to accomplish these goals in order to do these
workshops and help ACM become bigger as an organization and a community.
-  I plan to iterate my community plans frequently if needed.  I would like to
   be able to complete all my tasks within this semester and then reiterate on
them next semester to show changes.
