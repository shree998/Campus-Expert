## Introduction 👋

In this module, you'll learn about the history of Electron, how it relates to Javascript and Atom, and how to build Electron apps. The module is based on the on-demand Electron course created by GitHub Services, and covers everything you need to not only create your first Electron app, but package and distribute it too.

Electron is a great way to leverage the accessibility of web technologies to create desktop apps. There's something about a desktop app that feels very material versus the web; the things you learn on this training will make a really exciting introduction to desktop apps for members of your community, so as always with technical modules, think about how you can share this knowledge with your community.

## Exercise 📝

The exercise in this module is to create a standalone Electron app, either from scratch, or repurposing existing code.
