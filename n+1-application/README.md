## Introduction 👋

This module is the application to become a Campus Expert. You should only follow this module if you have completed the following:

- Module 0 - Getting Started.
- Module 1 - Introduction.
- At least 3 other modules (not including the Application module).

Please bear in mind the following requirements:

- Campus Experts must be 18 years of age and over.
- You must not be within 3 months of finishing your course of study.
- There is a limit to the number of Campus Experts per university. This limit is dependent on several factors. If in doubt, please check through one of the support channels listed below.

It's important to remember that Campus Experts is about _improving the community on your campus_. The modules that you complete before completing your application should be ones that will help you meet your impact proposal: choosing a module on a topic that you are already confident in will not teach you further useful skills that you can use to help your peers. During the application to become a Campus Expert, your module choices will be evaluated against how well they address the needs of your impact proposal.

To apply to become a Campus Expert, complete the exercise. During this exercise, we'll collect some information from you and find a time to have a chat.

Once you submit your application, we'll review your application and let you know as soon as possible whether we are able to make you a full Campus Expert.

## What happens once I'm a Campus Expert? 🤔

Being a Campus Expert means making a difference to the community on your campus. As a Campus Expert, you will try to implement the impact proposal you created in Module 1. Once you become a Campus Expert, you will have access to further support and mentorship in acting out your impact proposal, and making a difference to your community.

Campus Experts get added to a repository where you can request access to resources and ask for help with your activities and events. At the bottom of every training module, you will find a list of perks that you and your community gain access to upon completing that module. Once your application is accepted, you can start to use these benefits.

Due to the per-campus limit on the number of Campus Experts, Campus Experts that are inactive for a long period of time, may have their position re-evaluated. If you have concerns about the time commitment of being a Campus Expert, or know in advance you may be unavailable for some period of time, let us know through the support channels below.
